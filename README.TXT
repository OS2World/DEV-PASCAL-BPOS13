The files in this archive are a translation of the OS/2 1.3 Header
files to Pascal Units for use with the patched Borland Pascal 7.0
compiler.

The translation of the files was made by

  Peter Sawatzki, CIS: 100031,3002

and

  Peter Singer, CIS: 100024,1603

Suggestions and comments are welcome and should be directed to one of
the above.

Notice: the file PmDDim.Pas is not yet finished but we wanted to release
the archive as soon as possible so we left it as it is now.
